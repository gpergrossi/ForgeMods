problems:
- cliffs always on (whoops)
- cactus only spawn 1 high
- no memory management yet
- world seeds always the same
- rivers should be a terrain feature, not part of heightmap
- river head lakes need a solution that separates them from the heightmap code
- rivers should carve out caves if terrain is high enough around them




Feature idea: a long line of stone spires with a treasure at the end
Biome idea: stone forest

Polish: spawn chest
Great Polish: custom sky sphere with floating islands in the distance?
