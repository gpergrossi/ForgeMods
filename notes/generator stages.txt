Entry points to generation:
  1. Chunk loading
  2. Asking for a world spawn


Generator steps:

1. InfiniteVoronoi cell located
2. New Region object assigned to cell
3. Region is assigned a seed
4. Region generation:
   A. Region biome is assigned
   B. Region cells voronoi diagram constructed
   C. Islands Constructed
   D. Islands assigned IslandCells
   E. Region features populated:
      1. Each feature produces instances
      2. (Optional) Island altitude constraints created
   F. Altitude constraints solved. Islands assigned altitudes
5. Island generation:
   A. Biome extensions applied
   B. IslandBiome generates shape
   C. IslandBiome generates heightmap
   D. terrain features added to heightmap
   E. caves carved
6. Biomes are simply island's biome or region's empty-space biome


Region features are for:
- Island to island bridges
- Rivers/Waterfalls
- Structures (Strongholds, Villages, Jungle/Ocean Temples, Dungeons, etc.)
- Features added to all/some islands that wouldn't normally have them
- Non-island features

Region features should be able to:
1. Affect island cell groupings
2. Create altitude constraints
3. Set island biomes
4. Avoid island biomes
5. Read island's cell list
6. Create island features

Island features should be able to:
1. Modify the shape of islands (make sure rivers are inside erosion)
2. Modify island heightmaps (again, carving rivers)
3. Place and remove blocks in the pre-populate and post-populate phase
4. Add decorations to islands decorate list

Decorations are simple features like:
- Trees
- Rocks
- Flowers
- Grass

Decorations have two components:
1. A block generator
2. A "placement" class which decides:
   a. Where the decoration can be placed (under water, on grass, on sand, in caves, etc.)
   b. How many there are per island/chunk/volume/density
   c. Cluster count and radius
