Forward Compatability:
=========================
Add a semi-immutable production line for regions/islands
   steps in the process have a version number
Create a regenerate command for regions/islands
   saved islands and regions have some settings recorded
   such as: seed, size, biomes list, etc.
   to tell the user when its not possible to regenerate


Systems:
==============
Region feature system that supports rivers and similar without
   specific close integration with the island generator code


Missing Game Features:
=========================
Trees of every type
Accessible lava


Important Fixes:
===================
Rivers and head lakes look far too regular
Edge-of-chunk issue with trees eating eachother
Grass eating jungle shrubs
Jungle trees floating


Nice to haves:
=================
Jungle island roots
Feature placement option for full coverage with percent per tile
	(instead of randomly rolling coordinates and testing)
Mod capes?

Fixed/Done:
===================
(1/31)	Constraint system for waterfalls and future region features
(2/1)	Waterfalls should just go to the center of their edge
	  this requires more points in the bezier curve
(2/2)	Double3DTest#rotateTest failing
