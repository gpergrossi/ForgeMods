reference: https://bedrockminer.jimdo.com/modding-tutorials/basic-modding-1-7/updating-forge-gradle/

1. Close clipse

2. Edit build.gradle to:

   minecraft {
      version = "new.version.here" // latest version numbers at http://files.minecraftforge.net/
      runDir = "eclipse/assets"
   }

3. Run the following:

   gradlew cleanCache
   gradlew setupDecompWorkspace --refresh-dependencies
   gradlew eclipse //or idea

4. If there were errors, it's time to change the Gradle version number.
   Find this in build.gradle:
   
   buildscript {
       [...]
       dependencies {
           classpath 'net.minecraftforge.gradle:ForgeGradle:1.1-SNAPSHOT'
       }
   }
   
   Change the gradle version to work with the current release of forge.

5. If all else fails:
   a. backup source code
   b. download a fresh copy of forge developer tools
   c. setup the workspace
   d. copy in the source code backup
