![Development Screenshot](images/ktaqncffgzg01.png)

This build is compatable with forge 1.12.

# Build
1. Open a command prompt or shell in the `'<repo>/aerogen/'` directory.
2. Run `gradlew build`
3. Your mod jar file should appear in `'<repo>/aerogen/build/libs/aerogen-1.12.2-007.jar'`

# Usage
1. install forge for minecraft 1.12 on your minecrraft 1.12 client
2. place the mod jar in your minecraft mods folder
3. launch forge and make sure the aerogen mod was loaded
4. click to create a new single player world
5. go to generator settings and select the generator type "AeroGen"
6. click to finish creating the world

Note: this generator does not have all biomes from 1.12 and it generates no structures.
This means that playing through the game will be impossible because there is no End portal.
You can create an End portal in creative mode if you still wish to play though. Lava is
difficult to find and villagers can only be rescued from zombie. Think of it as a fun challenge.

# Biomes
- Oak Forest
- Birch Forest
- Plains
- Savannah
- Taiga (snowy with spruce trees)
- Jungle
- Dark Forest (dark oak)
- Desert
- Rivers

# Todo
- Add generated structures
- Red sand deserts
- Clay mesas
- More biomes

# Legacy

This mod used to be a Bukkit mod available at https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/aerogen.
This is a new version with a complete rewrite of the source code to explore ideas that 
weren't possible in the Bukkit version.
